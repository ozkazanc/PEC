Poker Equity Calculator

In this project, I wanted to calculate the probability of winning of each player in a round of Texas Hol'em Poker.
The program asks for a number of players and then displays their win probability as the round progresses.
Similar to how tv shows air poker hands where the player gets a percentage next to their name to show the audience their chance of winning that hand.
